#TO make a plot.
#proc gplot data=data; plot y*x=id; by trt;run;
#We need to sort the data with the order trt id and x; It's important to sort the data with the correct order.So we need to understand 
#what are the y and x in our plot and if we want to make subplots for different treatement, by trt is required.
#Sort by the subgroups first, then sort by id and then sort by x.
#goptions reset=all: would reset the plotting settings as default. 
#symbol1 i=join: i(interpolation) option specifies that the points are to be joined,
#i=line would lead a curvlinear; i=std1mjt: to get the mean structure, m computes sd,j connects the means from bar to bar with a line,
#  t:adds tops and bottoms to each line.
#Comments for how to use the symbol:  https://v8doc.sas.com/sashtml/gref/zbolchap.htm
#haxis= vaxis= : would help us to set the axises options.
#title : to make a title for the figure.
